Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                          | Action                                           |
| :--------------------------------| :----------------------------------------------- |

| `npm or pnpm run dev`            | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
